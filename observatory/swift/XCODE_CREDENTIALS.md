# Xcode Already Knows Your Credentials!

**Good news:** Xcode stores your Apple Developer credentials when you sign in!

---

## What Xcode Knows

When you sign in to Xcode with your Apple ID:

1. **Apple ID** ✅ - Stored in Xcode Preferences
2. **Team ID** ✅ - Stored per team
3. **Certificates** ✅ - Automatically managed
4. **Signing** ✅ - Xcode handles code signing

**Xcode does NOT store:**
- ❌ App-Specific Password (needed for API/CLI)
- ❌ API Keys (needed for CLI automation)

---

## Check What Xcode Has

### Option 1: Xcode GUI

1. **Open Xcode**
2. **Xcode > Preferences** (or Settings)
3. **Click "Accounts" tab**
4. **Select your Apple ID**
5. **Select your team**
6. **Team ID is shown** in the details pane

### Option 2: Command Line

**List teams:**
```bash
# Show all teams Xcode knows about
xcodebuild -list -project ObservatoryApp.xcodeproj 2>/dev/null || \
xcodebuild -showBuildSettings -project ObservatoryApp.xcodeproj | grep DEVELOPMENT_TEAM

# Or check keychain for certificates
security find-identity -v -p codesigning | grep "Developer ID\|Apple Development"
```

**Get Team ID from Xcode settings:**
```bash
# Extract Team ID from Xcode preferences (if available)
defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dt.Xcode.plist IDEProvisioningTeams 2>/dev/null | grep -A 1 "$APPLE_ID" | tail -1 | grep -o '[A-Z0-9]\{10\}'
```

## Extract Credentials from Xcode

**I can create a script that extracts what Xcode knows!**

### Script: Extract Team ID from Xcode

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Extract Team ID from Xcode preferences

# Method 1: From Xcode project settings
if [ -f "ObservatoryApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj" ]; then
    TEAM_ID=$(grep -m 1 "DEVELOPMENT_TEAM" ObservatoryApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj | sed 's/.*DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = \([^;]*\).*/\1/' | tr -d ' ')
    if [ -n "$TEAM_ID" ]; then
        echo "Team ID from Xcode project: $TEAM_ID"
    fi
fi

# Method 2: From Xcode accounts
# This is trickier - Xcode stores this in plist format
# Most reliable: Sign in to Xcode and check Preferences > Accounts
```

## For Our Script: What We Can Auto-Detect

### Already Known by Xcode:
- ✅ **Team ID** - Can extract from project settings
- ✅ **Apple ID** - Can extract from Xcode preferences
- ✅ **Signing** - Xcode handles automatically

### Still Need Manual:
- ⚠️ **App-Specific Password** - NOT stored by Xcode (needed for CLI)
- ⚠️ **API Key** - NOT stored by Xcode (if using API)

---

## Updated Script: Auto-Detect from Xcode

**We can update `submit_to_appstore.sh` to:**
1. Try to extract Team ID from Xcode project
2. Try to extract Apple ID from Xcode preferences
3. Fall back to ~/.env if not found
4. Only require App-Specific Password / API Key from ~/.env

---

## Quick Test: What Xcode Knows

**Check your Xcode project:**
```bash
cd observatory/swift

# Check if Xcode project has Team ID
grep -i "DEVELOPMENT_TEAM" ObservatoryApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj 2>/dev/null || echo "No Xcode project yet"

# Check Xcode preferences
defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dt.Xcode.plist IDEProvisioningTeams 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

## Best Approach

**Option A: Use Xcode for Signing, ~/.env for API Credentials**
- ✅ Xcode handles code signing (Team ID, certificates)
- ✅ ~/.env only needs App-Specific Password or API Key
- ✅ Minimal manual setup

**Option B: Auto-Detect from Xcode**
- ✅ Extract Team ID from Xcode project
- ✅ Extract Apple ID from Xcode preferences
- ✅ Only require API credentials in ~/.env

---

## Recommendation

**For now:**
1. **Sign in to Xcode** with your Apple ID (if not already)
2. **Select your team** in Xcode Preferences > Accounts
3. **Xcode will handle** Team ID and signing automatically
4. **Only fill in ~/.env** with:
   - App-Specific Password (for CLI automation)
   - OR API Key (for CLI automation)

**The script will:**
- Use Xcode's Team ID and signing (automatic)
- Use ~/.env for App Store Connect API credentials (manual)
