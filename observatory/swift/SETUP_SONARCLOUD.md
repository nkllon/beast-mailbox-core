# SonarCloud Setup for Swift Observatory App

## ✅ Setup Complete!

I've created the necessary configuration files for SonarCloud analysis of the Swift Observatory app.

## Files Created

1. **`observatory/swift/sonar-project.properties`** - SonarCloud configuration
2. **`.github/workflows/sonarcloud-swift.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow

## Next Steps

### 1. Create SonarCloud Project

1. Go to https://sonarcloud.io/
2. Log in with your GitHub account
3. Click "Analyze new project"
4. Select your GitHub repository
5. Choose **"Other"** category (for Swift)
6. **Project Key:** `nkllon_beast-observatory-swift`
7. **Organization:** `nkllon`

**Important:** Use the exact project key: `nkllon_beast-observatory-swift`

### 2. Verify Configuration

The configuration is already set up:

**`observatory/swift/sonar-project.properties`:**
```properties
sonar.projectKey=nkllon_beast-observatory-swift
sonar.organization=nkllon
sonar.sources=Sources/ObservatoryApp
sonar.tests=Tests
sonar.swift.version=5.9,6.0
```

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- Triggers on pushes to `observatory/swift/**`
- Runs on macOS (required for Swift)
- Builds and tests before analysis
- Uploads results to SonarCloud

### 3. Test the Setup

Once the SonarCloud project is created:

1. **Make a small change** to any Swift file:
   ```bash
   cd observatory/swift
   # Edit a file, then commit
   git add .
   git commit -m "test: Trigger SonarCloud Swift analysis"
   git push
   ```

2. **Check GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Look for "SonarCloud Analysis - Swift"
   - Verify it runs successfully

3. **Check SonarCloud:**
   - Go to https://sonarcloud.io/
   - Find project `nkllon_beast-observatory-swift`
   - Verify analysis results appear

## What Gets Analyzed

SonarCloud will analyze:

- ✅ **Code Smells** - Complexity, duplication, maintainability
- ✅ **Bugs** - Logic errors, null pointer issues
- ✅ **Security** - Vulnerabilities, unsafe operations
- ✅ **Test Coverage** - Function, branch, line coverage (if configured)
- ✅ **Code Quality** - Maintainability, reliability, security ratings

## Current Swift Version

Your Swift version: **6.2**

**Note:** SonarCloud officially supports Swift 3.0-5.10. Since you're on 6.2:
- ✅ The workflow will still run
- ✅ Analysis should work (SonarCloud usually supports newer versions)
- ⚠️ If issues occur, we can add version compatibility config

## Test Coverage (Future Enhancement)

Currently, test coverage generation isn't configured. To add it later:

1. **Generate coverage** during tests:
   ```bash
   swift test --enable-code-coverage
   ```

2. **Convert to XML format** (may need tool):
   - SonarCloud can read `.profdata` format with proper config
   - Or convert to XML using tools like `xcrun llvm-cov`

3. **Update workflow** to include coverage step

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Project not found"
**Solution:** Make sure the SonarCloud project key matches exactly: `nkllon_beast-observatory-swift`

### Issue: "Analysis failed"
**Solution:** Check:
- ✅ `SONAR_TOKEN` secret is set in GitHub
- ✅ Project exists in SonarCloud
- ✅ Organization name matches: `nkllon`

### Issue: "Swift version not supported"
**Solution:** Update `sonar.swift.version` in `sonar-project.properties`:
```properties
sonar.swift.version=6.0
```

## Status

- ✅ Configuration files created
- ⏳ SonarCloud project needs to be created (manual step)
- ⏳ First analysis will run on next push to `observatory/swift/`

**Ready to go!** Just create the SonarCloud project and push a change to trigger the first analysis.
