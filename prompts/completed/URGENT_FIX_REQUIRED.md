# 🚨 URGENT: Repository Out of Sync with Published Package

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FAILURE NOTICE

**Version 0.2.0 of `beast-mailbox-core` has been published to PyPI, but the source repository does NOT contain the corresponding changes.**

This is a **Category 1 Infrastructure Failure** that violates:
- Software supply chain integrity
- Version control principles
- Open source licensing requirements (MIT requires source availability)
- Basic professional software development standards
- Team trust and collaboration protocols

### Current State (Discovered: 2025-10-10)
- ✅ PyPI has version **0.2.0** published and publicly available
- ❌ GitHub repository `pyproject.toml` shows version **0.1.0**
- ❌ No git tag for `v0.2.0` exists in the repository
- ❌ No commit updating version to 0.2.0
- ❌ No changelog or release notes documenting changes
- ❌ No pull request or code review for v0.2.0 changes
- ❌ Complete absence of audit trail for what was published

**This breaks the fundamental contract of version control and package distribution.**

### Impact Assessment

**SEVERITY: CRITICAL**

1. **Trust Violation**: Users installing from PyPI cannot inspect the source code
2. **Security Risk**: No way to audit what code is running in production
3. **Legal Risk**: MIT license requires source availability - we're in violation
4. **Reproducibility**: Impossible to rebuild the exact published package
5. **Collaboration**: Team members are working with outdated codebase
6. **CI/CD**: Any automated systems are using wrong version
7. **Debugging**: Users reporting bugs against v0.2.0 that we can't reproduce

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Went Wrong

The failure occurred because you **published a package to PyPI without following proper version control procedures**. Specifically:

1. **Violated the Git-First Principle**: Changes were made and built locally without committing to version control
2. **Skipped Code Review**: No pull request was created, so no peer review occurred
3. **Ignored Release Checklist**: Did not follow standard release procedures (if they exist)
4. **No Tag Creation**: Git tags are the canonical way to mark releases - this was skipped
5. **Published from Wrong Location**: Built and published from a working directory that wasn't the canonical repository
6. **No Verification Step**: Did not verify that repository state matched published package

### Why This Happened

**Probable causes:**
- Working in multiple clones/directories of the same project
- Using an editable install that pointed to a different location
- Rushing the release without following procedure
- Lack of automated guardrails (no CI/CD to enforce workflow)
- Absence of documented release procedure
- Not understanding the relationship between git tags, versions, and releases

**Evidence:**
- Your editable install is from: `/Users/lou/kiro-2/kiro-ai-development-hackathon/packages/beast-mailbox-core`
- This repository is at: `/Users/lou/Documents/cursor/beast-mailbox-core`
- These are **different directories** - you published from one, we're looking at the other

### The Correct Workflow (That Was Not Followed)

The proper release workflow is:

```
1. Make changes in feature branch
2. Commit all changes
3. Push branch to GitHub
4. Create Pull Request
5. Code review and approval
6. Merge to main
7. Pull latest main locally
8. Update version in pyproject.toml
9. Update CHANGELOG.md
10. Commit version bump
11. Push to main
12. Create git tag (e.g., v0.2.0)
13. Push tag to GitHub
14. Build package: python -m build
15. Verify build contents
16. Publish to PyPI: twine upload dist/*
17. Verify on PyPI
18. Create GitHub Release with notes
```

**You skipped steps 1-13 and went straight to steps 14-16.**

This is unacceptable and must never happen again.

---

## Your Mission: Restore Repository Integrity

You need to:
1. **Recover the actual 0.2.0 source code** from wherever you built it
2. **Create a proper Pull Request** with all changes (following the process you should have followed initially)
3. **Update your /steering directory** with corrected procedures to prevent recurrence
4. **Follow the correct release workflow** going forward
5. **Complete a post-mortem** documenting what happened and how to prevent it

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Phase 1: Locate the Source of Truth

**Where did you build and publish 0.2.0 from?**

Likely candidates:
- `/Users/lou/kiro-2/kiro-ai-development-hackathon/packages/beast-mailbox-core`
- A local development directory
- A CI/CD pipeline (check if automated)

**Action:**
```bash
# Find where the package was built from
pip show beast-mailbox-core

# If you have an editable install, it will show:
# Editable project location: /path/to/actual/source

# Navigate there and check the version
cd /path/to/actual/source
cat pyproject.toml | grep version
git log --oneline -10
```

### Phase 2: Download and Inspect Published Package

If you can't find the source, reverse-engineer from PyPI:

```bash
# Download the published package
pip download beast-mailbox-core==0.2.0 --no-deps --dest /tmp/

# Extract and inspect
cd /tmp
tar -xzf beast-mailbox-core-0.2.0.tar.gz
cd beast-mailbox-core-0.2.0

# Compare with current repository
diff -r /tmp/beast-mailbox-core-0.2.0/src /Users/lou/Documents/cursor/beast-mailbox-core/src
```

### Phase 3: Create the Pull Request

Once you've identified the changes in 0.2.0, follow these steps precisely:

#### Step 3.1: Setup Clean Working Environment
```bash
# 1. Clone fresh copy of the repository (to avoid any local contamination)
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/nkllon/beast-mailbox-core.git beast-mailbox-core-sync
cd beast-mailbox-core-sync

# 2. Verify you're in the right place
git remote -v
git status

# 3. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b fix/sync-repo-with-v0.2.0
```

#### Step 3.2: Apply Changes from v0.2.0

You need to identify exactly what changed between 0.1.0 and 0.2.0. Use one of these methods:

**Method A: Copy from source directory (if you found it)**
```bash
# If you found the source at /path/to/actual/source
SOURCE_DIR="/Users/lou/kiro-2/kiro-ai-development-hackathon/packages/beast-mailbox-core"

# Compare files
diff -ur "$SOURCE_DIR/src" ./src

# Copy only changed files (review each carefully)
# Example:
# cp "$SOURCE_DIR/src/beast_mailbox_core/redis_mailbox.py" ./src/beast_mailbox_core/
# cp "$SOURCE_DIR/pyproject.toml" ./
```

**Method B: Reverse-engineer from PyPI package**
```bash
# Download and extract v0.2.0
mkdir /tmp/v0.2.0-analysis
cd /tmp/v0.2.0-analysis
pip download beast-mailbox-core==0.2.0 --no-deps
tar -xzf beast-mailbox-core-0.2.0.tar.gz

# Compare with repository
cd ~/workspace/beast-mailbox-core-sync
diff -ur /tmp/v0.2.0-analysis/beast-mailbox-core-0.2.0/src ./src
diff -u /tmp/v0.2.0-analysis/beast-mailbox-core-0.2.0/pyproject.toml ./pyproject.toml

# Copy changed files
# Be methodical - copy each changed file after reviewing
```

#### Step 3.3: Update Version and Documentation
```bash
# Update pyproject.toml version to 0.2.0
# Find the line: version = "0.1.0"
# Change it to: version = "0.2.0"
sed -i.bak 's/version = "0.1.0"/version = "0.2.0"/' pyproject.toml

# Create or update CHANGELOG.md
cat > CHANGELOG.md << 'EOF'
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

# Or go to: https://github.com/nkllon/beast-mailbox-core/compare/fix/sync-repo-with-v0.2.0
```

#### Step 3.7: Create Pull Request on GitHub

Go to the GitHub repository and create a PR with this information:
```

**Pull Request Title:**
```
🚨 CRITICAL: Sync repository with published v0.2.0
```

**Pull Request Description:**
```markdown
## Problem
Version 0.2.0 was published to PyPI without corresponding changes in the repository.
This breaks reproducibility and version control integrity.

## Changes
This PR synchronizes the repository with the package published as 0.2.0 on PyPI.

### Included in this PR:
- [ ] Version bump to 0.2.0 in pyproject.toml
- [ ] All code changes present in the published package
- [ ] Updated CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Any new dependencies or configuration

## Verification
```bash
# Install from this branch and verify it matches PyPI
pip install git+https://github.com/nkllon/beast-mailbox-core.git@fix/sync-repo-with-v0.2.0

# Compare behavior with PyPI version
pip install beast-mailbox-core==0.2.0
```

## Root Cause
The package was built and published from [LOCATION] without pushing changes to the repository.

## Prevention (addressed in future)
- [ ] Implement pre-release checklist
- [ ] Add git tag creation to release workflow
- [ ] Use GitHub Actions for automated releases
- [ ] Require git tags to match package versions
```

### Phase 4: Tag the Release (After PR Merge)

```bash
# After the PR is merged to main:
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release version 0.2.0

Synchronized repository with PyPI published package."

# Push the tag
git push origin v0.2.0

# Create GitHub Release
# Go to: https://github.com/nkllon/beast-mailbox-core/releases/new
# - Tag: v0.2.0
# - Title: v0.2.0
# - Description: Copy from CHANGELOG.md
```

## Recommended: Automated Release Workflow

To prevent this from happening again, implement GitHub Actions:

**`.github/workflows/release.yml`:**
```yaml
name: Release to PyPI

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
      
      - name: Verify version matches tag
        run: |
          TAG_VERSION=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/v}
          PKG_VERSION=$(grep '^version = ' pyproject.toml | cut -d'"' -f2)
          if [ "$TAG_VERSION" != "$PKG_VERSION" ]; then
            echo "Tag version ($TAG_VERSION) doesn't match package version ($PKG_VERSION)"
            exit 1
          fi
      
      - name: Install build dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install build twine
      
      - name: Build package
        run: python -m build
      
      - name: Publish to PyPI
        env:
          TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
          TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
        run: twine upload dist/*
      
      - name: Create GitHub Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          draft: false
          prerelease: false
```

## Timeline

**This needs to be fixed IMMEDIATELY because:**

1. ❌ Users cannot verify what code they're running
2. ❌ Security audits will fail
3. ❌ Cannot reproduce builds
4. ❌ Contributors don't know what changed
5. ❌ Violates basic software engineering practices
6. ❌ MIT license violation (source must be available)
7. ❌ Supply chain security compromised

**Expected completion: Within 24 hours**

### Completion Checklist

Mark each item as you complete it:

- [ ] Phase 1: Located v0.2.0 source code
- [ ] Phase 2: Compared with PyPI published package
- [ ] Phase 3: Created and merged PR to sync repository
- [ ] Phase 4: Created and pushed git tag v0.2.0
- [ ] Phase 5: Created GitHub Release with notes
- [ ] Phase 6: Updated /steering directory with corrected procedures
- [ ] Phase 7: Completed post-mortem document
- [ ] Verified: Repository now matches PyPI package

---

## MANDATORY: Update Your /steering Directory

As part of fixing this issue, you **MUST** update your agent's `/steering` directory to prevent this from ever happening again.

### Task: Create `/steering/release-procedure-CORRECTED.md`

This document must replace any incorrect procedures you were following. Create it with the following content:

```markdown
# ⚠️ CORRECTED: Python Package Release Procedure

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** MANDATORY - This procedure must be followed without exception  
**Supersedes:** Any previous informal or incorrect release procedures

## Incident Report

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Package:** beast-mailbox-core  
**Severity:** Critical

### What Happened
Version 0.2.0 was published to PyPI without committing changes to the repository,
creating a complete break in version control integrity and violating supply chain security.

### Lesson Learned
**NEVER publish a package without committing, tagging, and pushing to the repository first.**

---

## The ONLY Correct Release Procedure

### Pre-Release Requirements

Before you even THINK about publishing:

1. ✅ All code changes are committed and pushed to GitHub
2. ✅ All changes have gone through pull request review
3. ✅ All tests pass
4. ✅ No linter errors
5. ✅ Working in the CANONICAL repository (not a fork or alternate clone)

### Release Steps (Must Follow in Order)

#### Step 1: Prepare Release Branch
```bash
# Ensure you're in the correct repository
pwd  # Verify this is the canonical repo location
git remote -v  # Verify origin points to correct GitHub repo

# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v0.X.Y
```

#### Step 2: Update Version and Changelog
```bash
# Edit pyproject.toml - update version line
# Edit CHANGELOG.md - add release notes

git add pyproject.toml CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Bump version to 0.X.Y"
git push origin release/v0.X.Y
```

#### Step 3: Create Pull Request
- Create PR from release/v0.X.Y to main
- Title: "Release v0.X.Y"
- Wait for review and approval
- Merge PR

#### Step 4: Tag the Release
```bash
# Pull the merged changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Verify version in pyproject.toml matches intended release
grep "^version" pyproject.toml

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v0.X.Y -m "Release version 0.X.Y"

# Push tag
git push origin v0.X.Y

# VERIFY tag is on GitHub
git ls-remote --tags origin | grep v0.X.Y
```

#### Step 5: Build Package
```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info

# Install build tools
pip install --upgrade build twine

# Build
python -m build

# Verify built package
tar -tzf dist/beast-mailbox-core-0.X.Y.tar.gz | head -20
```

#### Step 6: Test Publication (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Upload to Test PyPI first
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Install from Test PyPI and verify
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ beast-mailbox-core==0.X.Y

# Test basic functionality
beast-mailbox-service --help
beast-mailbox-send --help
```

#### Step 7: Publish to PyPI
```bash
# Only proceed if Test PyPI worked
twine upload dist/*

# Verify on PyPI
pip install beast-mailbox-core==0.X.Y
pip show beast-mailbox-core
```

#### Step 8: Create GitHub Release
1. Go to https://github.com/nkllon/beast-mailbox-core/releases/new
2. Select tag: v0.X.Y
3. Release title: v0.X.Y
4. Description: Copy from CHANGELOG.md
5. Publish release

#### Step 9: Verify Everything
```bash
# Repository check
git log --oneline -5
git tag | grep v0.X.Y

# PyPI check
pip index versions beast-mailbox-core

# GitHub check - verify release exists
# GitHub check - verify tag exists
```

## Critical Rules

### ❌ NEVER DO THESE:

1. **NEVER** publish without pushing commits first
2. **NEVER** publish without creating a git tag
3. **NEVER** publish from a directory that isn't the main repository
4. **NEVER** skip the Test PyPI step
5. **NEVER** skip code review (even for version bumps)
6. **NEVER** rush a release
7. **NEVER** assume you remember the correct procedure

### ✅ ALWAYS DO THESE:

1. **ALWAYS** verify you're in the correct repository directory
2. **ALWAYS** check that git status is clean before tagging
3. **ALWAYS** use Test PyPI first
4. **ALWAYS** verify the tag is pushed before publishing
5. **ALWAYS** create a GitHub Release after publishing
6. **ALWAYS** follow the checklist completely
7. **ALWAYS** update CHANGELOG.md

---

## Verification Questions

Before publishing, answer YES to all:

- [ ] Are all my changes committed?
- [ ] Are all my changes pushed to GitHub?
- [ ] Have my changes been reviewed in a PR?
- [ ] Is the PR merged to main?
- [ ] Am I working in the canonical repository?
- [ ] Have I created and pushed the git tag?
- [ ] Does the tag match the version in pyproject.toml?
- [ ] Have I tested on Test PyPI?
- [ ] Have I verified the package contents?

**If ANY answer is NO, STOP and complete that step first.**

---

## Emergency Contact

If confused or uncertain at ANY point:
1. STOP immediately
2. Do NOT publish
3. Ask for help
4. Review this document again

---

## Automation (Future)

To prevent human error, we will implement:
- GitHub Actions to automate releases from tags
- Pre-commit hooks to verify version consistency
- Automated tests on release branches
- Automated GitHub Release creation

Until automation is in place, follow this manual procedure without deviation.

---

**This procedure was created in response to a critical incident. Following it is not optional.**
```

### Save This Document

Save the above content to your `/steering` directory as `release-procedure-CORRECTED.md` and:

1. **Delete** any outdated or incorrect release procedures
2. **Reference** this document in your agent configuration
3. **Review** this document before every release
4. **Update** this document if you discover issues with the procedure

### Verify You Understand

Before proceeding, write a brief acknowledgment that you:
1. Understand what went wrong
2. Understand why it was critical
3. Commit to following the corrected procedure
4. Have saved the corrected procedure to your /steering directory

---

## Questions?

If you're unable to locate the source of 0.2.0 or need assistance:
1. Check your shell history: `history | grep -i build`
2. Check for uncommitted changes: `git stash list`
3. Check other branches: `git branch -a`
4. Check other clones: `find ~ -name beast-mailbox-core -type d 2>/dev/null`
5. Worst case: Yank 0.2.0 from PyPI and republish correctly

---

## Final Warning
