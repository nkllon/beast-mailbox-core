# 🔧 SONARCLOUD: Fix Main Branch Configuration

## The Problem

```
Warning: "master" branch has not been analyzed yet
```

**Root Cause:** SonarCloud is configured to use "master" as the main branch, but our repository uses "main".

---

## The Fix (2 Minutes)

### Option 1: Use Direct Administration Link (Easiest)

1. **Go directly to:** https://sonarcloud.io/project/administration/branches?id=nkllon_beast-mailbox-core

2. **Log in** when prompted

3. **Rename main branch** from "master" to "main"
   - Save changes

4. **Done!** Quality Gate badges will populate within 1-2 minutes

### Option 2: Manual Navigation

1. **Visit:** https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=nkllon_beast-mailbox-core

2. **Log in** (top right button)

3. **Click on "Branches 1"** in the left sidebar
   - You'll see: "master" marked as "Main Branch"
   - Message: "No other branch analyzed yet"

4. **Look for Administration or Settings** (only visible when logged in)
   - Should be a gear icon or "Administration" tab
   - Navigate to Branch settings

5. **Change main branch** from "master" to "main"

### Option 3: Delete and Recreate (Nuclear Option)

If the UI is confusing:

1. **Delete the SonarCloud project** entirely in the web UI

2. **Recreate it:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/lou/Documents/cursor/beast-mailbox-core
   export SONAR_TOKEN='ab75c53285f1a6b6a1f5e198e3086043091c77c9'
   python3 /Users/lou/kiro-2/kiro-ai-development-hackathon/scripts/setup_sonarcloud.py \
     --project-key nkllon_beast-mailbox-core \
     --project-name "Beast Mailbox Core" \
     --organization nkllon
   ```

3. **Trigger analysis:**
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: initial SonarCloud analysis on main"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. SonarCloud should auto-detect "main" this time

## What I Found Via Browser

**Current SonarCloud State:**
- Branches page shows: 1 Long-lived branch: **"master" (Main Branch)**
- Says: "No other branch analyzed yet"
- But API shows "main" exists as a short-lived branch

**What We Need:**
- Change "master" → "main" as the main branch
- Or delete "master" so "main" becomes the only long-lived branch

---

## Why This Happened

When the SonarCloud project was created, it defaulted to "master" as the main branch (SonarCloud's historical default). Since our repo uses "main", we need to update this setting.

---

## Timeline

**Should take < 5 minutes total:**
- 1 min: Log in
- 1 min: Find branch settings
- 30 sec: Change master → main
- 2 min: Wait for quality gate to compute

---

## Expected Result

**After fixing:**
- ✅ Quality Gate badge shows "Passed" (green)
- ✅ Coverage badge shows actual percentage
- ✅ No more warnings about master branch
- ✅ All future analyses run on "main"

**Current badges show:**
- ❌ Quality Gate: "not computed"
- ❌ Coverage: "not computed"

---

## If You Can't Log In

If you don't have access to the SonarCloud nkllon organization:

1. Ask for admin access
2. Or ask someone with access to complete these steps
3. Or I can delete/recreate the project (Option 3 above)

Once this is done, ALL badges will be fully operational! 🎯
