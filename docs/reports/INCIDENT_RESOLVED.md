2. ✅ PR merged to main: commit 9b0d677
3. ✅ Git tag v0.2.0 created with detailed message
4. ✅ Tag pushed to origin
5. ✅ GitHub Release created: https://github.com/nkllon/beast-mailbox-core/releases/tag/v0.2.0
6. ✅ `/steering` directory created with corrected procedures

## Preventive Measures Implemented

### 1. Process Documentation
**File:** `/steering/release-procedure-CORRECTED.md`

Complete 9-step release procedure including:
- Pre-release requirements checklist
- Step-by-step commands
- Critical rules (7 NEVERs, 7 ALWAYs)
- Verification questions (9 must-answer items)
- Incident timeline for reference

### 2. Transparency
**CHANGELOG.md Meta Section:**
```markdown
### Meta
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This release was retroactively synced to repository 
  after being published to PyPI
- Repository integrity restored through PR #1
- This represents a process failure that has been corrected
- Updated release procedures to prevent recurrence
```

### 3. Educational Documentation
- `URGENT_FIX_REQUIRED.md` - Comprehensive incident guide
- `PR_CREATED_FOR_YOU.md` - Educational follow-up for agent
- `INCIDENT_RESOLVED.md` - This completion summary

---

## Lessons Learned

### Root Cause
1. Multiple directory clones of the same project
2. Publishing from non-canonical location
3. No verification that repository matched build
4. Lack of documented release procedure
5. No automated guardrails

### Key Takeaway
**The Git-First Principle is non-negotiable:**
```
Code → Commit → Push → Tag → Push Tag → Build → Test → Publish
```
**NEVER skip version control steps.**

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Implement GitHub Actions for automated releases
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for version verification
- [ ] Create automated tests for release branches
- [ ] Set up Test PyPI in CI/CD pipeline

## Impact Assessment

### Before Resolution
- ❌ Users couldn't audit source code
- ❌ Security vulnerability (unknown code in production)
- ❌ MIT license violation (source not available)
- ❌ Reproducibility impossible
- ❌ Team working with wrong version
- ❌ Supply chain integrity broken

### After Resolution
- ✅ Full source code available and auditable
- ✅ Version control integrity restored
- ✅ License compliance achieved
- ✅ Reproducible builds enabled
- ✅ Team synchronized on v0.2.0
- ✅ Supply chain secured
- ✅ Incident transparently documented

---

## Verification Commands

Anyone can now verify the repository integrity:

```bash
# Check repository version
git clone https://github.com/nkllon/beast-mailbox-core.git
cd beast-mailbox-core
grep "^version" pyproject.toml
# Output: version = "0.2.0"

# Check tag exists
git tag | grep v0.2.0
# Output: v0.2.0

# Check PyPI matches
pip index versions beast-mailbox-core
# Output: LATEST: 0.2.0

# Check GitHub Release
gh release view v0.2.0
# Output: Full release notes

# Build from source and compare
python -m build
# Should produce identical package to PyPI
```
