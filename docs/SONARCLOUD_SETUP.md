# SonarCloud Setup - Manual Configuration Required

## Issue: Default Branch Not Analyzed

**Error:** "Your default branch has not been analyzed yet"

**Root Cause:** SonarCloud project was created via API but the main branch configuration needs to be set manually in the web UI.

## Solution: Configure Main Branch

### Steps:

1. **Go to Project Settings**
   - Visit: https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=nkllon_beast-mailbox-core
   - Click **"Administration"** tab
   - Click **"Branches and Pull Requests"**

2. **Set Main Branch**
   - Under "Main Branch" section
   - Select **"main"** from the dropdown
   - Click **"Rename main branch"** or **"Set as main branch"**
   - Save changes

3. **Trigger Fresh Analysis** (if needed)
   ```bash
   cd /Users/lou/Documents/cursor/beast-mailbox-core
   git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger SonarCloud re-analysis"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Verify**
   - Check: https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=nkllon_beast-mailbox-core
   - Quality Gate badge should now show status
   - Coverage metrics should populate

## Alternative: Delete and Recreate Project

If the above doesn't work:

1. Delete the project in SonarCloud UI
2. Re-run setup script:
   ```bash
   export SONAR_TOKEN='ab75c53285f1a6b6a1f5e198e3086043091c77c9'
   python3 /Users/lou/kiro-2/kiro-ai-development-hackathon/scripts/setup_sonarcloud.py \
     --project-key nkllon_beast-mailbox-core \
     --project-name "Beast Mailbox Core" \
     --organization nkllon
   ```
3. Push to trigger first analysis on main
4. SonarCloud should properly recognize main branch

## Current Status

- ✅ SonarCloud project created: `nkllon_beast-mailbox-core`
- ✅ SONAR_TOKEN configured in GitHub secrets
- ✅ Workflow file in place (`.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml`)
- ✅ Analysis running successfully (3 source files analyzed)
- ❌ Main branch not configured - **needs manual web UI configuration**

## Expected Result

Once configured, the Quality Gate badge will show:
- **Passed** (green) if code quality meets standards
- **Failed** (red) if issues detected

Coverage badge will show actual code coverage percentage.
